# Hallmark

**A design skill that studies what you admire — and rebuilds your content with it.**

→ Live demo: **[hallmark-murex.vercel.app](https://hallmark-murex.vercel.app)** · twenty-three themes, eight worked tests, press `T` to cycle.
→ Current version: **v0.9.0** — adds the **Editorial** theme (open-design-inspired premium · warm cream + coral + Inter Tight × Playfair italic) and a small kit of open-design utilities any theme can reach for: Roman-numeral section heads, corner-bracket image annotations, dark-slab section reversal, pulse animation for live indicators, and a `.tnum` tabular-numerals utility.
→ Previously in **v0.8**: genres (editorial · modern-minimal · atmospheric · playful), `design.md` for whole-project redesigns, the 2+1 font rule with 55-gate slop test, component-library exports, 9 nav archetypes (incl Floating pill), 8 footer archetypes, 4 hero polish patterns, contrast gates 46–50, nav/footer/hero structural gates 51–55.

Hallmark is the **anti-AI-slop** rule-set for Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex. It encodes the [tactile-rebellion](https://www.creativebloq.com/design/graphic-design/texture-warmth-and-tactile-rebellion-the-big-graphic-design-trends-for-2026) consensus — typography, colour, layout, motion, microinteractions, structural variety — into one opinionated skill that refuses to emit the on-distribution defaults every LLM was trained into.

## Try it

Paste this into Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex with the Hallmark skill installed:

> *"Build me a landing page for Coffeebox — a small-batch coffee subscription. Roast on Sunday, ship on Monday, drink Tuesday. Audience: people who already buy good coffee. Tone: warm, hand-set, editorial."*

If Hallmark is wired correctly, you'll see Long Document · Linen (warm-paper roman-serif) · Tier-B hand-built SVG. Eight more worked briefs are documented in [`docs/recipes.md`](docs/recipes.md) — copy/paste them to discover the skill before reading anything else.

## What's distinct — quick map vs the field

|  | Hallmark | [frontend-design](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) (Anthropic) | [Open Design](https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design) | [Dembrandt](https://github.com/dembrandt/dembrandt) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Source of taste** | extracts DNA from a screenshot you admire (`study` verb) | art-director brief + ban list | menu of 72 brand presets (Linear, Stripe, Vercel, Notion…) | scrapes a live URL, emits computed tokens |
| **Output unit** | macrostructure + theme + custom-craft | bans + brief framing | preset application | DTCG `tokens.json` |
| **Refuses font ID** | yes — names role, never guesses | n/a | n/a | n/a (computes from CSS) |
| **Refuses pixel-clone** | yes — DNA only, never pixels | n/a | n/a | n/a (full token export) |
| **Tactile-rebellion alignment** | warm-paper, custom-craft, slopless canon | strong | medium | none — token-only |
| **Pages by archetype** | 21 named macrostructures, picked per brief | by brief | 5 deterministic directions | n/a |
| **Verbs** | 5 (default · `audit` · `refine` · `redesign` · `study`) | 1 | 31 | 1 (CLI) |

Hallmark's edge is **`study`** — every other tool ships a preset menu or a scraper. Hallmark is the only one that takes a screenshot of a design you admire, names what it sees, refuses paid-template-marketplace listings, and rebuilds your content with the extracted DNA. Three worked study examples in [`docs/study-examples.md`](docs/study-examples.md).

## Five verbs

| Verb | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| *(default)* | Build new UI. Asks for audience + use + tone (skippable — the skill states what it inferred). Picks a macrostructure, applies the rule-set, runs the slop test before handing back. |
| `hallmark audit <target>` | Score existing code against the named anti-patterns + structural sameness. Punch list, no edits. |
| `hallmark refine <target>` | Polish in place. Smallest possible diff. Preserves structure. |
| `hallmark redesign <target> [--mood <name>]` | Throw out the structure, keep copy + IA + brand, rebuild with a deliberately different fingerprint. |
| **`hallmark study <screenshot>`** | The differentiator. Extract the **DNA** from a design the user admires — macrostructure, archetypes, type-pairing role, colour anchor — and produce a diagnosis report. Optionally rebuild *the user's* content using the extracted DNA. **Refuses paid templates and competitor pages. Names font roles, never font IDs. Never copies pixels.** |

## Eight pages, eight different shapes

Generated by exercising the skill across contrasting briefs. No two share a macrostructure or theme.

Each page is its own self-contained HTML + CSS — no shared theme, no shared layout. Every one carries a `/* Hallmark · macrostructure: … */` stamp at the top of its CSS. See the full set under [`site/_tests/`](site/_tests/) or live at [hallmark-murex.vercel.app](https://hallmark-murex.vercel.app).

## What's inside

- **[`SKILL.md`](skill/SKILL.md)** — the routing file. Six-step design flow (including `Step 2.5 · Check project memory` reading `.hallmark/log.json`), 55-gate slop test, output contract, always-on `tokens.css` export.
- **[`references/`](skill/references/)** — short, opinionated rule files: typography, colour, layout, motion, microinteractions, interaction-and-states (with the input-state checklist), responsive, copy, anti-patterns, the 21 named macrostructures, the **40 component archetypes** with variation knobs (9 hero · 6 feature · 4 CTA · 4 testimonial · **8 footer · 9 nav**), the **4 hero polish patterns** (in `hero-enrichment.md`), the 6 primitive structure axes, the vision-extraction protocol for `study`, hero enrichment, custom-craft (CSS art over Lottie), assets, the slop-test gates, four genre rule-overlays (each with nav + footer voice routing), per-verb dispatchers, and the export-formats reference (Tailwind / DTCG / shadcn / tokens.css).
- **[`docs/`](docs/)** — human-reading content: **[`recipes.md`](docs/recipes.md)** (8 worked briefs + a canonical try-it prompt) and **[`study-examples.md`](docs/study-examples.md)** (3 worked DNA-extractions). Not auto-loaded by the skill.
- **[`site/`](site/)** — a self-demonstrating landing page. Hand-written HTML + CSS + ES module, no framework, no build step. **Twenty-two themes** clustered into four genres: **editorial** (Specimen, Atelier, Newsprint, Salon, Linen, Almanac, Garden, Studio, Sport, Riso, Brutal, Manifesto), **modern-minimal** (Quiet, Coral, Violet), **atmospheric** (Midnight, Terminal, Bloom, Aurora, Halo), **playful** (Pastel, Plume). Switching themes literally rebuilds the page — different hero archetype, different footer archetype, different nav archetype.

## What's distinct (the long list)

- **One skill, five verbs.** Not eighteen commands.
- **Genres broaden the range.** Hallmark routes a brief through one of four genres before picking a theme: **editorial** (default · the canonical anti-slop voice), **modern-minimal** (Stripe / Linear / ElevenLabs school), **atmospheric** (Suno / Runway / dark-AI-tool school), **playful** (post-Linear soft school). Each genre is its own rule overlay — atmospheric allows radial blooms; modern-minimal allows pure white and pill CTAs; editorial bans both. Detection is signal-based, silent default to editorial.
- **Tone is a first-class decision.** "Clean and modern" is rejected. Pick an extreme — *editorial · brutalist · soft · technical · luxury · playful · austere*.
- **Macrostructures over axes.** Pick one of 21 named whole-page shapes wholesale; the macrostructure stamp lives in the CSS comment, so the next Hallmark run picks something different.
- **Within-archetype variation.** Two Bento Grids should not be twins; each archetype has 2–3 picked-per-output knobs.
- **Microinteractions as discipline.** Silent success over celebratory toasts. Optimistic update + Undo over confirm dialogs. Hover delay 800 ms, focus delay 0 ms.
- **A 55-gate slop test** runs before every output. One yes fails the build. Recent additions: typography discipline gates (39–40: max three font families per page, outlier face used in ≤ 2 slots), input-state gates (41–45: no border-width layout shift, focus ring via outline not border, input height matches button height, helper-text slot reserves height, disabled state needs three independent signals), contrast gates (46–50: APCA / WCAG thresholds, accent-ink token requirement, dark-section ink-on-ink check), and **nav · footer · hero structural gates (51–55: AI nav fingerprint, AI footer fingerprint, hero centred-everything, hero padding asymmetry, decorative-without-purpose)**.
- **Project memory.** A per-project `.hallmark/log.json` records each run's macrostructure + theme + enrichment + brief summary. The skill reads the last 3–5 entries before picking and writes a new entry after each build, so consecutive Hallmark outputs in the same project don't repeat shapes or themes.
- **Theme-diversification rule.** Two consecutive themes must differ on at least one of three axes: paper band (dark / mid / light), display style (italic-serif / roman-serif / geometric-sans / mono / display-heavy / system-native), accent hue (warm / cool / neutral / chromatic-other).
- **Voice fixtures over LLM defaults.** Each of the 21 macrostructures ships with 2–3 example opening lines tuned to its tone. "Built for the modern team" is in the banned-phrases list.
- **Hero enrichment is opt-in.** A typographic-only hero is always acceptable. When enrichment is right, the skill picks from a six-tier hierarchy: typography only → custom-built CSS art → hand-built SVG → generated illustration (Nanobanana / Recraft) → library → Lottie (last resort).
- **Microinteractions default-on for SaaS-shaped archetypes.** Bento Grid, Stat-Led, Workbench, Marquee Hero pages ship with 2–3 purposeful microinteractions (number reveal, pricing lift, marquee, stagger) without the user having to ask. Editorial / Manifesto / Letter / Quote-Led pages stay still.
- **SaaS page sequence.** Hero → social proof → features → testimonials → pricing → FAQ → CTA → footer. Real prices, not "contact sales for pricing." Specific testimonials with role + company.
- **Wordmark may use a different display face.** A Geist-bodied SaaS page can set its wordmark in Fraunces. Same-family collapse on Bento / Stat-Led / Workbench / Marquee Hero is the new "un-branded" tell.
- **`study` extracts DNA, not pixels.** Refusal heuristics, type-role vocabulary (no font ID guessing), confirmation step before any code. Three worked examples in [`docs/study-examples.md`](docs/study-examples.md).

# Structure

Most AI-generated UIs are visually distinct but structurally identical: hero → three features → CTA → footer. Same heading positions, same column counts, same component vocabulary. **Structural sameness is the AI fingerprint, not visual sameness.** Hallmark's job is to break it.

This file catalogues the **primitive axes** of structural variety. For most builds you should NOT compose a fingerprint axis-by-axis from this file — instead pick a named whole-page shape from [`macrostructures.md`](macrostructures.md), which is faster and prevents default-attractor sameness. Use this file when you need to deviate from a macrostructure's defaults on one or two axes, or when you're auditing an existing page and need vocabulary for what you see.

The axes below are still the building blocks. Pick one option from each to form a *structural fingerprint*. Two pages should never share the same fingerprint.

## The six axes

### 1. Section-heading placement

Where does a section's title live in space? Pick one per page.

| Pattern | Description | Real-world reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Left-margin** | Eyebrow / number / label sits in a narrow left column; heading and body to the right. Editorial / specimen. | The New York Times Magazine; our Specimen theme. |
| **Hanging** | Heading floats in negative space *above* the section, with generous breathing room. | David Airey's portfolio; minimal modernist. |
| **Centered display** | Heading dominates centre stage, symmetrical. Formal, welcoming, can feel static if used everywhere. | Apple product pages; Atelier-style runway invitations. |
| **Bottom-aligned** | Heading anchors the *base* of a section, content flows above. Inverts hierarchy. | Swiss editorial; Newsprint masthead-below pattern. |
| **Overlapping image** | Heading layered atop photography or colour block. Demands strong contrast. | Pentagram project pages; Manifesto posters. |
| **Sticky / pinned** | Heading remains visible while content scrolls beneath. Orientation aid. | GSAP ScrollTrigger docs; Almanac-style references. |
| **Numbered display** | "01." with a rule line and the heading right beside it. Procedural, sequenced. | Rauno Freiberg's portfolio. |
| **Inline with body** | No section break — the heading emerges from the paragraph flow. Conversational. | Medium articles; long-form essays. |

### 2. Body composition

How does long-form content lay out beyond "single column at 65ch"?

| Pattern | When | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Single column** | Narrative-first, reading-led. The default for editorial. | Most blogs. |
| **Two-column asymmetric** | Wide body + narrow margin column for metadata, captions, marginalia. | Semplice; Linen-style. |
| **Multi-column justified** | Newspaper rhythm; 2–3 narrow columns, hyphenated, justified. | The Guardian; FT.com; Newsprint. |
| **Marginalia** | Sidenotes in a generous outer margin run alongside core text. | Tufte CSS; scholarly publications. |
| **Three-column equal** | Encyclopedia / reference / data-density. Chunked, scannable. | Wikipedia; Whole Earth Catalog; Almanac. |
| **Full-bleed with margin reset** | Body at 65ch, but pull-quotes or images bleed full-viewport. Emphasis via scale change. | Medium pull-quotes; Manifesto sections. |
| **Asymmetric spans** | Columns vary widthwise; intentional 2-1-3 ratios via CSS Grid. | Locomotive; portfolio sites. |

### 3. Divider language

How do sections separate?

- **Hairline rule.** 0.5–1px line, inset or full-bleed. Hallmark's default; modernist.
- **Ornament.** Fleuron (`❦`), centered dot, geometric mark. Salon, editorial classic.
- **Negative space.** No rule at all — the gap *is* the divider. Apple, Linen, modern minimalism.
- **Bleed-color block.** Section background colour shifts; the colour edge is the divider. Manifesto, Brutal.
- **Double rule / typographic mark.** Top + bottom line tight together; signals masthead in Newsprint.

### 4. Button voice

How do CTAs happen?

- **Outlined.** Border, no fill. Secondary or quiet primary. Hallmark default.
- **Unstyled link.** Underlined word, no box. Trust the typography. Editorial / craft sites.
- **Oversized solid.** Big block of accent colour, full padding. Manifesto, Sport, statement-CTA.
- **Typographic-only.** A word in a specific weight/size/colour, no rule, no box. Looks like a headline that happens to be clickable. Atelier, Salon.
- **Form-as-CTA.** The button is part of an inline form; the action *is* fill-this-field. Newsletter signups.

### 5. Image treatment

How does imagery enter the page?

- **Full-bleed.** Edge-to-edge, viewport width, image as architecture. Manifesto, Sport.
- **Tightly cropped.** Small, deliberate, sized to grid. Almanac, Atelier still-life.
- **Inline with text.** Image flows within the paragraph rhythm, sized to measure. Editorial, Newsprint.
- **Margin-aligned.** Image sits in the wide outer margin; body unbroken. Linen, Tufte.
- **None.** No imagery; typography carries everything. Specimen, Manifesto-as-text-poster, Terminal.

### 6. Reveal pattern

What happens on page-load and on scroll?

- **Fade-up stagger.** Default. Subtle, broadly safe; orchestrated once with exponential ease-out.
- **Horizontal sweep.** Element slides in from one edge; clip-path or transform. Directional momentum.
- **Type-unmask.** clip-path animates open over text. Graceful when the type is the hero.
- **Number-tick.** Counter from 0 to final value; for stats, prices, dates. Almanac, dashboards.
- **Typewriter.** Character-by-character; honest about the medium. Terminal only.
- **None.** Everything is just there at load. Some sites should not move. Pentagram, brutalist sites.

## Picking a fingerprint

A fingerprint = one choice per axis. There are 8 × 7 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 6 = **42 000** fingerprints. You will never run out.

Two rules govern choices:

1. **Coherence.** A Newsprint page with multi-column justified body should have a typographic CTA, not an oversized solid button — those don't share a voice. Pick choices that belong to the same *world*.
2. **Anti-repetition.** Across consecutive pages built in the same session, no two should share more than three of the six axes. If the previous page used left-margin headings + single column + hairline divider + outlined button, this page should differ on at least three of those.

## Theme-suggested fingerprints

Each Hallmark theme has a default structural fingerprint. Use them as starting points only when the brief specifies a theme. **For most builds, pick a macrostructure from [`macrostructures.md`](macrostructures.md) instead** — themes describe *visual surface*, macrostructures describe *page shape*; the latter drives variety more.

The table below is alphabetical by theme to neutralise any "first row = default" attractor. No theme is the default.

| Theme | Heading | Body | Divider | Button | Image | Reveal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Almanac | Sticky | Three-column equal | Hairline | Outlined | Inline | Number-tick |
| Atelier | Centered | Single column | Negative space | Typographic-only | Tightly cropped | Type-unmask |
| Brutal | Overlapping image | Full-bleed reset | Bleed-colour | Oversized solid | Full-bleed | Horizontal sweep |
| Garden | Hanging | Marginalia | Negative space | Unstyled link | Margin-aligned | None |
| Linen | Hanging | Two-column asymmetric | Negative space | Unstyled link | Margin-aligned | Fade-up |
| Manifesto | Overlapping image | Full-bleed reset | Bleed-colour | Oversized solid | Full-bleed | Horizontal sweep |
| Midnight | Numbered display | Single column | Hairline | Typographic-only | None | Typewriter |
| Newsprint | Bottom-aligned | Multi-column justified | Double rule | Outlined | Inline | None |
| Salon | Centered | Single column narrow | Ornament (fleuron) | Outlined | Tightly cropped | None |
| Specimen | Left-margin | Asymmetric spans | Hairline | Outlined | None | Fade-up |
| Sport | Numbered display | Asymmetric spans | Bleed-colour | Oversized solid | Full-bleed | Horizontal sweep |
| Terminal | Inline (with `>` prompt) | Single column | Negative space | Typographic-only `[ go ]` | None | Typewriter |

## Anti-patterns of structural sameness

Reject these structural fingerprints. They are the AI-template fingerprint.

- **The SaaS hero.** Centered display heading, centered subhead, centered pill CTA, full-viewport hero, fade-up. The single most-recognised AI structural fingerprint.
- **The 3-feature row.** Three equal columns of icon-above-heading-above-two-line-body, gapped at 24px, identical card padding.
- **The benefits-then-CTA.** A list of feature bullets followed by a "Sign up" button block. Predictable rhythm.
- **The everything-fades-in.** Every section gets the same scroll-triggered fade-up animation. Makes the page feel like a presentation.
- **The carbon-copy footer.** Logo, four columns of links, social row, copyright. The same on every site you've ever seen.

## When you don't know

If the brief doesn't suggest a fingerprint and the user hasn't picked a theme, **do not default**. Offer the user three named macrostructures from *categorically different* groups, and let them pick. For example:

- **Bento Grid** — modular, feature-led, many entry points.
- **Long Document** — prose-led, one continuous narrative, no marketing structure.
- **Manifesto** — declarative large type, one belief per fold, polemical.

Three concrete page-shapes beat seven abstract tones. If the user shrugs and says "you pick", roll a die: pick whichever of the three is most *categorically distant* from any previous Hallmark output for this user (read the existing CSS for a `/* Hallmark · macrostructure: ... */` stamp and avoid that family).

If the user answers a vague tone word ("modern", "clean", "professional"), that is not a feeling. Re-ask with the three concrete macrostructures above.
